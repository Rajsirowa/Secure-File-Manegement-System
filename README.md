# Secure-File-Manegement-System

**Project Overview: Secure File Management System (SFMS)**

The Secure File Management System (SFMS) is a software solution designed to store, manage, and share digital files securely. It ensures that only authorized users can access, modify, or share files, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, data breaches, and loss.

### Key Features:

* **User Authentication & Role-Based Access** – Ensures only verified users can log in, with permissions based on roles (admin, user, etc.).
* **File Encryption** – All files are encrypted during storage and transmission.
* **Secure Upload/Download** – Files are transferred over secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
* **Version Control** – Maintains file history for edits and updates.
* **Audit Trails** – Logs user activity for tracking and compliance.
* **Backup & Recovery** – Ensures data is backed up and recoverable in case of failure.

### Objective:

To create a reliable, scalable, and secure platform that allows users to store, access, and manage their files with complete confidentiality and integrity.
